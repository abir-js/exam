# 🛠️ Software Engineering Viva Preparation Guide

## 🔹 Introduction to Software Engineering
- What is Software Engineering?
- Software vs Program vs Application
- Characteristics of good software:
  - Correctness, Efficiency, Maintainability, Reusability, Portability
- SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) Phases:
  - Requirement Gathering → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

## 🔹 Software Process Models
- Waterfall Model
- V-Model
- Incremental Model
- Spiral Model
- Agile Methodology (Scrum, XP)

## 🔹 Requirement Engineering
- Functional vs Non-functional Requirements
- SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
- Feasibility Study
- Use Case Diagrams (UML)

## 🔹 Software Design
- Design Principles (Modularity, Cohesion, Coupling, Abstraction, Encapsulation)
- Architectural Design: layered, client-server, MVC
- DFD (Data Flow Diagram)
- ER Diagram
- UML Diagrams: Class, Activity, Sequence, Use Case

## 🔹 Coding and Implementation
- Programming principles: structured programming, coding standards
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Version control systems (e.g., Git basics)

## 🔹 Software Testing
- Levels of Testing:
  - Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance
- Types of Testing:
  - Manual vs Automation
  - Black-box vs White-box
  - Regression, Performance, Stress, Usability
- Test Case, Test Plan, Test Suite
- Debugging

## 🔹 Software Maintenance
- Types:
  - Corrective, Adaptive, Perfective, Preventive
- Software Reengineering

## 🔹 Software Metrics and Quality
- LOC (Lines of Code)
- Function Points
- Cyclomatic Complexity
- Software Quality Attributes: reliability, usability, efficiency
- ISO & CMMI standards

## 🔹 Project Management
- Project Planning, Scheduling, Monitoring
- Gantt Charts, PERT, CPM
- Risk Management
- Cost Estimation Techniques:
  - LOC, Function Point Analysis, COCOMO Model

## 🔹 Configuration Management
- Version Control (Git, SVN)
- Change Control
- Build and Release Management

## 🔹 CASE Tools
- What are CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools?
- Upper CASE, Lower CASE, Integrated CASE tools

- Difference between black-box and white-box testing?
- What is cohesion and coupling?
- Explain the concept of COCOMO.
- What is regression testing?
- Describe risk management in a project.
- What are software metrics and why are they used?
