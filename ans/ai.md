# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Viva Q&A

## 🔹 What is the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broader field of making machines behave like humans.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data.
- **Example**: AI = self-driving car, ML = model that learns to detect pedestrians.

## 🔹 What are the types of agents in AI?

1. **Simple Reflex Agent** – Acts only on current percept.
2. **Model-Based Reflex Agent** – Uses internal memory/state.
3. **Goal-Based Agent** – Considers goals for decision-making.
4. **Utility-Based Agent** – Considers best outcome (utility).
5. **Learning Agent** – Learns and improves over time.

## 🔹 Explain BFS vs DFS.

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**:
  - Explores nodes level-wise.
  - Uses a queue.
  - Finds the shortest path.
  
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:
  - Explores as deep as possible.
  - Uses a stack or recursion.
  - Can get stuck in deep branches.

## 🔹 What is A* Search and how does it work?

- A* is an informed search algorithm.
- Uses formula: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
  - `g(n)` = cost from start to current node.
  - `h(n)` = estimated cost from current to goal (heuristic).
- Finds optimal and efficient path if heuristic is admissible.

## 🔹 What is the Minimax Algorithm?

- Used in game-playing AI.
- Assumes two players: MAX and MIN.
- MAX maximizes score, MIN minimizes score.
- Explores all possible moves to choose the best one.

---

## 🔹 Define Knowledge Representation with examples.

- A way to store and organize knowledge for reasoning.
- Methods:
  - **Propositional Logic**
  - **First Order Predicate Logic**
  - **Semantic Networks**
  - **Frames**
  - **Ontologies**

---

## 🔹 Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?

- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Labeled data.
  - Example: Email spam detection.
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - Unlabeled data.
  - Example: Customer segmentation using clustering.

---

## 🔹 What is an Expert System? Give examples.

- A system that mimics human expert decision-making.
- Components:
  - **Knowledge Base**
  - **Inference Engine**
  - **User Interface**
- Examples: **MYCIN**, **DENDRAL**

---

## 🔹 How does Fuzzy Logic work?

- Allows reasoning with uncertainty.
- Truth values range from 0 to 1.
- Example: “Temperature is 0.8 hot” instead of just hot or cold.

---

## 🔹 What is NLP and its real-world applications?

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** enables computers to understand human language.
- Applications:
  - Chatbots
  - Machine Translation
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Speech Recognition
  - Email filtering

> 💡 **Tip**: Use simple examples (like a maze for search or chess for minimax) to explain concepts during the viva!
