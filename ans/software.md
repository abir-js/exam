# 🛠️ Software Engineering Viva Preparation Guide

## 🔹 Introduction to Software Engineering
- **What is Software Engineering?**
  - It is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software.
- **Software vs Program vs Application:**
  - **Software:** A set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers.
  - **Program:** A small piece of software that performs a specific task.
  - **Application:** A complete and functional software designed for end users.
- **Characteristics of Good Software:**
  - Correctness, Efficiency, Maintainability, Reusability, Portability
- **SDLC Phases:**
  - Requirement Gathering → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

## 🔹 Software Process Models
- **Waterfall Model:** Linear sequential flow. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- **V-Model:** Extension of Waterfall. Testing is planned parallel to development.
- **Incremental Model:** Software is developed and delivered in increments.
- **Spiral Model:** Combines iterative and Waterfall with risk analysis.
- **Agile Methodology:** Iterative and incremental model focusing on collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery. (e.g., Scrum, XP)

## 🔹 Requirement Engineering
- **Functional Requirements:** Define specific behavior or functions.
- **Non-functional Requirements:** Define system attributes (e.g., performance, usability).
- **SRS:** Document that captures all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Feasibility Study:** Determines technical, operational, and economic feasibility.
- **Use Case Diagrams:** UML diagram showing system interactions with users.

## 🔹 Software Design
- **Design Principles:**
  - Modularity: Break into modules
  - Cohesion: Relatedness within a module
  - Coupling: Dependency between modules
  - Abstraction & Encapsulation: Hide complexity and protect data
- **Architectural Design:**
  - Examples: Layered architecture, Client-server, MVC
- **DFD:** Shows flow of data in the system
- **ER Diagram:** Shows entities and relationships
- **UML Diagrams:** Class, Activity, Sequence, Use Case

## 🔹 Coding and Implementation
- **Principles:** Structured programming, following coding standards
- **Code Reviews:** Improve quality, identify bugs early
- **Version Control:** Git, SVN for tracking changes in code

## 🔹 Software Testing
- **Testing Levels:**
  - Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance
- **Types:**
  - Manual vs Automation, Black-box vs White-box
  - Regression, Performance, Stress, Usability
- **Testing Terms:**
  - Test Case: Defines input and expected output
  - Test Plan: Document describing testing strategy
  - Test Suite: Collection of test cases
- **Debugging:** Process of identifying and fixing bugs

## 🔹 Software Maintenance
- **Types:**
  - Corrective: Fix bugs
  - Adaptive: Adjust to environment changes
  - Perfective: Improve performance
  - Preventive: Prevent future issues
- **Reengineering:** Improve system structure without changing functionality

## 🔹 Software Metrics and Quality
- **LOC:** Measures size of software
- **Function Points:** Based on functionality provided
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Measures number of independent paths
- **Software Quality Attributes:** Reliability, Usability, Efficiency
- **Standards:** ISO (International Standards), CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

## 🔹 Project Management
- **Activities:** Planning, Scheduling, Monitoring
- **Tools:** Gantt Charts, PERT, CPM
- **Risk Management:** Identify, assess, mitigate project risks
- **Cost Estimation:**
  - LOC-based, Function Point Analysis, COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

## 🔹 Configuration Management
- **Version Control:** Tools like Git, SVN
- **Change Control:** Process of managing changes
- **Build & Release Management:** Compiling and delivering the product

## 🔹 CASE Tools
- **Definition:** Tools that support software development and maintenance
- **Types:**
  - Upper CASE: Requirement & Design
  - Lower CASE: Coding & Testing
  - Integrated CASE: Full SDLC support

## 🔹 Common Viva Questions
- **What are functional and non-functional requirements?**
  - Functional: What the system should do; Non-functional: How the system performs.
- **Explain the Waterfall vs Agile model.**
  - Waterfall: Sequential; Agile: Iterative, customer-focused.
- **What is the purpose of SRS?**
  - Acts as a contract between client and developer, clearly stating requirements.
- **Difference between black-box and white-box testing?**
  - Black-box: Tests functionality without knowing internal code.
  - White-box: Tests internal structure and logic.
- **What is cohesion and coupling?**
  - Cohesion: Degree to which elements of a module belong together.
  - Coupling: Degree of interdependence between modules.
- **Explain the concept of COCOMO.**
  - A cost estimation model based on project size and complexity.
- **What is regression testing?**
  - Testing after changes to ensure existing features still work.
- **Describe risk management in a project.**
  - Process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks.
- **What are software metrics and why are they used?**
  - Quantitative measures (e.g., LOC, Function Points) to assess software quality and productivity.
