# 🌐 Computer Networks Viva Preparation Guide

## 🔹 Introduction to Computer Networks
- What is a Computer Network?
- Types of Networks:
  - LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN
- Topologies:
  - Star, Ring, Bus, Mesh, Hybrid
- OSI vs TCP/IP Models

## 🔹 OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Physical Layer** – bits, cables, connectors
2. **Data Link Layer** – frames, MAC address, switches
3. **Network Layer** – routing, IP address, routers
4. **Transport Layer** – end-to-end delivery, TCP/UDP, ports
5. **Session Layer** – session management
6. **Presentation Layer** – encryption/decryption, compression
7. **Application Layer** – interfaces for user applications (HTTP, FTP)

## 🔹 TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
- Application
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Access

## 🔹 Transmission Media
- Guided:
  - Twisted pair, Coaxial cable, Fiber optics
- Unguided:
  - Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared

## 🔹 Switching Techniques
- Circuit Switching
- Packet Switching
- Message Switching

## 🔹 IP Addressing
- IPv4 vs IPv6
- Classes of IPv4 (A, B, C, D, E)
- Subnetting and Supernetting
- Public vs Private IPs
- Loopback Address (`127.0.0.1`)

## 🔹 Protocols and Ports
- HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
- FTP (21), SFTP (22)
- SMTP (25), POP3 (110), IMAP (143)
- DNS (53)
- DHCP (67, 68)
- TELNET (23), SSH (22)

## 🔹 Routing and Switching
- Static vs Dynamic Routing
- Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP
- Switch vs Router vs Hub
- MAC Address vs IP Address

## 🔹 Transport Layer
- TCP vs UDP (connection-oriented vs connectionless)
- Three-way Handshake (TCP)
- Flow control (Sliding Window, Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N)
- Congestion Control: Slow Start, AIMD

## 🔹 Application Layer Protocols
- HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP
- Client-Server Architecture
- Peer-to-Peer Networks

## 🔹 Network Devices
- Repeater
- Hub
- Switch
- Router
- Bridge
- Gateway
- Modem

## 🔹 Network Security
- Firewalls
- Encryption (Symmetric vs Asymmetric)
- VPN
- SSL/TLS
- Common attacks: DoS, DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Phishing

## 🔹 Miscellaneous Topics
- DNS and how it works
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- ICMP and Ping
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- DHCP (IP assignment)
- URL vs IP Address
- Proxy Server and its use

## 🔹 Common Viva Questions
- Difference between TCP and UDP?
- What is an IP address and how is it different from MAC address?
- Explain the OSI layers with functions.
- Difference between Hub, Switch, and Router?
- What is Subnetting?
- What is the use of DNS?
- What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
- How does the internet work?

> 💡 **Tip:** Use analogies like postal service (IP address = house address, port = room number) to explain answers simply!
